Hi, for some time now I have been learning to code in C++. I admit that I wanted to start a project that was a bit complex for a first project, but I still managed to have a fairly conclusive basis I think (tell me and modify my code if I am wrong). The only problem is that I have too many errors and when I manage to correct one, others appear, I would need your help to correct this and explain my errors to me so that I do not repeat them. I would like to point out that I used ChatGPT. Thanks in advance!
